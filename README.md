# OxiLedger

An application made for tracking personal finances. Built with [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/) and [Axum](https://docs.rs/axum/).

# Development

To get started, install Rust, dioxus-cli, and sqlx-cli.

## Serving

Run the following command in the root of your project to start developing with the default platform:

```bash
dx serve --platform web
```

To run for a different platform, use the `--platform platform` flag. E.g.
```bash
dx serve --platform desktop
```

## Preparing Database Files

When building the Docker image, SQLx needs to run in offline mode. This requires prepared files, which can be generated with the following command:

```bash
cargo sqlx prepare --workspace -- --features server
```
